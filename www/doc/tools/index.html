<h3>Overview</h3>
<div class="articlebody">
<p>
This document describes how to use DarwinBuild to build Darwin projects.
It gives a simple example of how to rebuild the apache_mod_php sources to
configure with --with-ldap-sasl.  More advanced topics, like how to alter
build settings, or create your own build, will be covered later.

<div class="article">
<a name="install"></a><h3>Installation</h3>
<div class="articlebody">
<p>
This section describes how to install DarwinBuild 0.7 or later.  DarwinBuild 0.7 can
be downloaded from the <a href="../../releases/index.html">Releases</a> page.
Alternatively, you can obtain the sources via <a href="../../sources.html">CVS</a>.
</p>
<p>
By default, DarwinBuild will install into /usr/local, and you will need to make sure
that /usr/local/bin is in your shell's PATH variable.  If you want to change the
installation location, edit the <tt>common.mk</tt> file in the darwinbuild directory.
</p>
<p>
DarwinBuild has been tested on Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther), Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger).
The following is an example of downloading the 0.7 release and installing it on Mac OS X:
</p>
<pre>
$ curl -O http://www.opendarwin.org/projects/darwinbuild/releases/darwinbuild-0.7.tar.gz
$ tar xzf darwinbuild-0.7.tar.gz
$ cd darwinbuild-0.7
$ make
$ sudo make install
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div class="article">
<a name="init"></a><h3>Creating a Build Directory</h3>
<div class="articlebody">
<p>
The build directory contains a hierarchy of directories that DarwinBuild uses
while building Darwin projects.  Since some sources require a case sensitive
filesystem to build successfully (e.g. cvs), it's recommended to create your
build directory on a case-sensitive HFSX or UFS volume.
</p>
<p>If you  do not already have a partition that you can use for this purpose,
you can create a disk image with the following command (for Mac OS X only):
</p>
<pre>
$ hdiutil create -size 4g -type UDIF -fs HFSX -volname Builds \
        -uid 0 -gid 0 -attach Builds.dmg
</pre>
<p>
<b>Important:</b> if you use a disk image, be sure to uncheck the "Ignore
ownership on this volume" setting in the Finder's Get Info panel for the volume.
Otherwise, the results of your builds will not have any meaningful ownerships
and will likely fail to work.
</p>
<p>
For the remainder of this section, we will assume the build directory is to
be located inside /Volumes/Builds, the mount point of the Builds disk image.
</p>
<p>
Once you've chosen a location for your build directory, create and initialize
it with the following commands.  The darwinbuild -init command requires a build
number to be specified.  This indicates which version of the Darwin sources you
want to use as a base while building.  Use the 
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/sw_vers.1.html">sw_vers</a>
tool to determine which
build of Mac OS X you are currently running (see the
<a href="#builds">Currently Supported Builds</a> section for more information).
The build number used during initialization is stored in the build directory,
and will be used as the default value for future darwinbuild operations.

# ls
.build  Headers Logs    Roots   Sources Symbols
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The .build directory contains private data for the DarwinBuild system and shouldn't
need to be inspected directly.
The Logs directory will contain the build log for each attempt to build a Darwin project.
The Roots directory will contain the results of successful builds of Darwin projects.
The Headers directory will contain the results of any installhdrs builds (See the
<a href="http://opendarwin.org/projects/darwinbuild/doc/build/index.html#installhdrs">installhdrs</a>
section of Building Darwin Projects for more information).
The Symbols directory will contain the debug-symboled versions of successful builds
of Darwin projects.
The Sources directory contains the cached source code of Darwin projects.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="article">
<a name="fetch"></a><h3>Downloading and Modifying Sources</h3>
<div class="articlebody">
<p>
DarwinBuild provides a -fetch argument which will download the correct set of source code
for the current build number (as determined by the current build directory).  The sources
will be downloaded into the Sources directory as a .tar.gz archive.  DarwinBuild will use
these sources when building the project, but if a directory of the same name (without the
.tar.gz suffix) is present inside Sources, then that directory will take precedent.
In this way, you can extract the sources and modify them before building with DarwinBuild.
</p>
<p>
The following example shows how to fetch and modify the apache_mod_php sources prior to
building.
</p>
<pre>
# darwinbuild -fetch apache_mod_php
*** Fetching Sources ...
Attempting to download http://darwinsource.opendarwin.org/tarballs/other//apache_mod_php-18.tar.gz ...

# cd Sources
# tar xzf apache_mod_php-18.tar.gz
# vi apache_mod_php-18/Makefile
(... add --with-ldap-sasl to Extra_Configure_Flags)
# cd ..
</pre>
</div>
</div>


<div class="article">
<a name="build"></a><h3>Building Darwin Projects</h3>
<div class="articlebody">
<p>
From within the build directory, a simple command to darwinbuild will start the build process.
In order to ensure accurate, successful builds, DarwinBuild performs all build operations in
a special environment, separate from the base system.  First, DarwinBuild determines which
tools will be needed to build the software, downloads them from the OpenDarwin servers, and
loads them into the BuildRoot directory.  Then, using the
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/chroot.8.html">chroot</a>
command, DarwinBuild changes the root directory to BuildRoot.  This allows DarwinBuild to use
private headers and tools without polluting the base system (see the
<a href="http://opendarwin.org/projects/darwinbuild/doc/build/index.html#dependencies">dependencies</a>
section of Building Darwin Projects for more information).
</p>
<p>
All output sent to the terminal during the build will also be logged in a file in the Logs
directory.  The Log file will have the same name as the project-version currently being built.
In addition, a build number is appended to the filename (separated by a ~).  The build number
is incremented with each attempt to build the project, so that you can compare the results of
various attempts.
</p>
<p>If the build is successful, the results are copied into the Roots directory.  If any debug-
symboled versions are available, they will be copied into the Symbols directory.  Both the
Roots and Symbols directories are named with the same convention as the log file.
</p>
<p>The following example shows how to build the apache_mod_php sources</p>
<pre>
# darwinbuild apache_mod_php
