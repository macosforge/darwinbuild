This is an informal document on the core darwinxref plugins, describing
what queries the plugins support, and what plist input format they
use. This should eventually make its way to the online documentation.

* binary_sites
Meaning: "binary_sites" stores a set of URLs from where archived
	 build roots can be downloaded.
Input plist: Each build can have an array of "binary_sites",
      which are URLs. Additionally, each project can have
      a set of URLs.
Query: If a project had "binary_sites", it will be returned.
       If not, the global "binary_sites" for that build will
       be returned (not currently implemented XXX). If
       no project is specified, the global "binary_sites" for
       the build will be returned.

* plist_sites
Meaning: "plist_sites" stores a set of URLs from where
	 additional build plists can be downloaded, for instance
	 to resolve "inherits" build chains
Input plist: Each build can have an array of "plist_sites"
Query: The set of URLs for the build will be returned.


* source_sites

* patchfiles
Meaning: "patchfiles" stores a set of patch file names
	 for a project which can be downloaded from "source_sites".
	 To avoid collisions, names should be unique unless
	 a patch applies to multiple project versions.
Input plist: Each project can have an array of "patchfiles"
Query: The set of patch file names for a given build and
       project will be returned.
