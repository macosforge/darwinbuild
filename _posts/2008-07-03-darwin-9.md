If you are trying to build projects for Darwin 9, there are a few tips you should know about to help:

* Install darwinbuild from the [trunk of our subversion](https://darwinbuild.macosforge.org/trac/wiki#DownloadSource "subversion trunk") repo. We have added some basic support for Xcode 3.0 and Leopard to it that has not made it into an "official" release.
* Store your build environments on a UFS partition (disk images work for this). There is a problem with xcodebuild when running in a chroot on certain filesystems, like HFS+. Other filesystems might also work.  You know you've hit [this problem](https://darwinbuild.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/1 "ticket #1") if your build errors out immediately with "cannot find xcode project".
* Building or loading the CF project will populate your environment with CF-Lite. This will cause problems for xcodebuild. During the installXcode phase, Darwinbuild will grab a copy of your Host's CF, and thats the CF you should use to run xcodebuild (since it also comes from your Host).
